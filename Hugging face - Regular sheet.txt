=== HUGGING FACE  ===



Theory + Practicle 

2- in advance learn HF very good

3- HF is an website which provide models, dataset, pipeline, transformer
	data scientist, nlp, ai , llm model , all of them use this tools build project
	
4- what is HF ?
	gen ai , llm project -- these model so large we cannot work these project in cpu 
			we must need to purchase gpu more cost
			
HF is platform which introduce to help learner, studeent, praction, research to use
	HF platform and we can build state of the art model (SOTA)
	
5- shall we work team 
	huggingface.co 
	
6- llm models are 2 part 

		text based model  --> user enter text model generate text 
		multimodel  --> 
				user text prompt -- model generate image, video, audio
				multimodel is called state of the art 
7- huggingface website & Platform

8- lets do few basic practicle & I am suing google colab for that 

9- google - google colab - connect to gpu 

POC:1 -- TEXT GENERATION MODEL USING 
				(HF TRASFORMER + GPT2 MODEL)
				
POC:2 -- NER ( NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION)

PROJECT:1 - SENTIMENT ANALSYSI USING GRADIO

PROJECT:2 : TEXT IMAGE MODEL
